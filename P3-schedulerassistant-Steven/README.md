11-17-21 Automation Can currently create new sheet with copy of data from previous week and update the qc week for each batch as well as remove any batches past 13 without issue; The automation has an issue delete rows for regular ten week branches that still needs to be addressed

11-18-21 Automation can currently populate new sheets past first one that copies data from sheet made for previous week; The feature to increment and remove batches has been broken down in this iteration in order to create a new iteration that works across new sheets since the previous process only worked on the first sheet generated

11-19-21 Completed Automation to remove batches and schedule showcase; Issue of empty rows remaining in new sheets still occurs
